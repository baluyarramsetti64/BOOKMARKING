<p>Karthik Sivakumar (born 25 May 1977), known professionally as Karthi, is an Indian actor who is known for his works in Tamil Cinema. The youngest son of veteran actor Sivakumar and the younger brother of actor Suriya, he began his career with roles in films such as an uncredited cameo role in Aayutha Ezhuthu (2004). He then achieved his breakthrough role in his debut film Paruthiveeran (2007). After a three-year hiatus from acting, he then return to star in films such as Aayirathil Orvuan, Paiyaa and Naan Mahaan Alla, all three of which were released in 2010. He then continued to star in films such as Siruthai (2011), Saguni (2012), Alex Pandian (2013), All In All Azhagu Raja (2013) and Biriyani (2013).

Karthi has starred in several well-known Indian films, portraying an impulsive and short-tempered working-class man in Madras (2014), a paroled convict-turned-caretaker in Tamil-Telugu bilingual comedy-drama film Oopiri / Thozha, and in dual roles as the titular protagonist and the antagonist Raj Nayak in Kaashmora (both in 2016). He also starred as Theeran Thumiran in Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017), for which he was earned for a Filmfare Award South award, as Dilli in Kaithi (2019), as Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan in Ponniyin Selvan: I (2022) and its sequel (2023), and in the spy-thriller film Sardar (2022).

Acting career
2004–2007 ; Debut success
When Karthi returned to Chennai, he met director Mani Ratnam and got a chance to work as an assistant director in Aayutha Ezhuthu, because he wanted to become a film director and preferred directing to acting,[1] though he did appear as an extra in Aayutha Ezhuthu.[citation needed] He continued to receive acting offers and his father convinced him to take up acting, telling him " ... one can always direct films, but one will not get a chance to act once you grow older".[2] He accepted his first acting assignment with Priyamani as female lead in April 2005.[citation needed] When director Ameer approached him to play the titular character in the film Paruthiveeran, he accepted the offer because the film was " ... so compelling".[1] The filming started in July 2005 and experienced financial difficulties,[citation needed] and was almost abandoned by mid–2006.[citation needed] It was released in January 2007, to critical acclaim and became commercially successful.[3]

Critics unanimously praised Karthi's portrayal of a careless village ruffian. Sify said: "It's hard to believe that it is Karthi's debut film as he is just spectacular. His expressions, anger, laughter and anguish are all so realistic that you can feel the fire in him."[4] Rediff called his performance "excellent",[5] and " ... one of the top performances of 2007".[6] Karthi received several accolades for his performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in Tamil.[7]

<p>2008–2011: Break after Paruthiveeran
In October 2006, Karthi signed his second project under Selvaraghavan's direction,[8] Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam, which was supposed to be a romance film,[9] featuring Sandhya as the female lead.[10] Karthi's character was a " ... sophisticated upmarket stylish guy ... ".[11] Selvaraghavan abandoned that project and in July 2007, he announced the production of an action-adventure film titled Aayirathil Oruvan, with Karthi in the lead role.[12] Filming began later that year and was expected to be completed by February 2008. The producers planned to release it in mid-2008,[13] but production was delayed and filming continued until early 2009.[14] He had agreed to play the lead character in Linguswamy's next film Paiyaa, in September 2007.[citation needed] Because of the slow progress of Aayirathil Oruvan, Paiyaa was postponed several times.[15] He later said that he became anxious because he received several film offers, but could not work on them because he needed to maintain the continuity of his looks.[16] During the filming of Aayirathil Oruvan, producer R.Ravindran complained that Karthi was trying to change his look and move on to Paiyaa before finishing his commitments.[17]

Aayirathil Oruvan was released in early 2010. Karthi's portrayal of a chief coolie was often compared to that in his debut film.[18] Sify called Karthi's performance " ... a scream.", and said, "Right from his introduction scene till the end, he is lovable and provides humour.", and that he had " ... made a sensational comeback ... ".[19]

In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, featuring an album by Yuvan Shankar Raja,[20] it was very successful.[21][22] For the first time, he enacted a character that lives in an urban area.[23] He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen.[23] Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category.[citation needed] Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.[citation needed]
